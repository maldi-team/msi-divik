# Spectre

Spectre is a versatile tool used for analysis of MALDI-MSI data sets.

For the sake of simplicity, the toolset provided is available to be used
through interfacing with web application, which is currently a work-in-progress.

In order to build and run the application, please refer to the
[installation](#install) section.

## About

The project is currently in its early stage. However, it comprises the
implementation of our own spectra modelling based on Gaussian Mixture Models,
and Divisive IK-means algorithm for unsupervised segmentation, which can be
used for efficient dataset compression as well as for knowledge discovery.
Aformentioned algorithms have already been published and links refering
have been enclosed under [references](#references) section.

Also, several classification and clusterization methods will be provided soon,
along with supporting statistics.

## Install

Details will be added soon.

## Exemplary usage

Details will be added soon.

## How to contribute?

Please contact us by an [e-mail](mailto:Grzegorz.Mrukwa@polsl.pl). We will
answer you in details.

## Environment

Details will be added soon.
